# Imputation_with_LU_Simulation

A more efficient imputation technique is developed by LU (lower–upper) simulation in this work: (lower–upper) triangular decomposition of the correlation matrix. Cholesky factorization is applied on correlation (covariance) matrix between features and missing data are imputed via conditioning on non-missing values. The relationships between features are reproduced and the associated uncertainty in missing data are quantified after imputation. This approach requires less computational power for large datasets. In this post, Python code is implemented to apply the technique on synthetic data and realistic data.


Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Imputation_with_LU_Simulation.git) page.
